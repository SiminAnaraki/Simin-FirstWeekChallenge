# Simin-FirstWeekChallenge

This is the landing page of a marketing agency that I received as a starter code and made changes.
I used Semantic HTML elements instead of non-semantic tags and by adding alt atribiute,a good title and proper comments I tried to make
the code better and more readable.Also I made sure HTML elements and CSS follow a logical structure.
